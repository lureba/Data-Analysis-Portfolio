### [Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis of ENEM](https://github.com/lureba/ENEM-EDA-EN-US)
- Description: In this data analysis project, our focus was on the detailed exploration of the 2022 ENEM (National High School Exam) data. The central aim of this work was to clean, organize, and subsequently analyze this extensive dataset. Using Jupyter Notebook as our platform, we relied on a robust set of Python libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Geopandas, to conduct various stages of the project.

- Analysis: In the analysis phase, our goal was to investigate socioeconomic and demographic factors that might be related to candidates' performance in the ENEM. Rather than developing predictive models, we chose to focus our efforts on creating informative and intuitive data visualizations. The purpose was to interpret these visualizations to identify patterns and trends that could provide insights into the factors that enhance or limit students' performance on the exam.

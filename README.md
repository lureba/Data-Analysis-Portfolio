## Projects
### [Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis of ENEM](https://github.com/lureba/ENEM-EDA-EN-US)
- Description: In this data analysis project, our focus was on the detailed exploration of the 2022 ENEM (National High School Exam) data. The central aim of this work was to clean, organize, and subsequently analyze this extensive dataset. Using Jupyter Notebook as our platform, we relied on a robust set of Python libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Geopandas, to conduct various stages of the project.

- Analysis: In the analysis phase, our goal was to investigate socioeconomic and demographic factors that might be related to candidates' performance in the ENEM. Rather than developing predictive models, we chose to focus our efforts on creating informative and intuitive data visualizations. The purpose was to interpret these visualizations to identify patterns and trends that could provide insights into the factors that enhance or limit students' performance on the exam.

### [Titanic: Machine Learning Model and Data Storytelling](https://github.com/lureba/Titanic-US)
- Description: In this project, we focused on exploring the Titanic dataset through both a data analysis and machine learning approach. The primary objective was to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data to understand the factors influencing passenger survival. We used Jupyter Notebook as our platform, leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to perform various stages of the project, from data exploration to model building and evaluation.

- Analysis: During the analysis phase, our focus was on identifying key factors—such as passenger demographics, ticket class, and embarkation port—that contributed to survival chances. Instead of focusing solely on predictive modeling, we emphasized the creation of clear and insightful data visualizations to communicate the story behind the data. These visualizations aimed to reveal patterns and relationships that provide a deeper understanding of the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.

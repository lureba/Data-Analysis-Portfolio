## Projects
### [Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis of ENEM](https://github.com/lureba/ENEM-EDA-EN-US)
- Description: In this data analysis project, our focus was on the detailed exploration of the 2022 ENEM (National High School Exam) data. The central aim of this work was to clean, organize, and subsequently analyze this extensive dataset. Using Jupyter Notebook as our platform, we relied on a robust set of Python libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Geopandas, to conduct various stages of the project.

- Analysis: In the analysis phase, our goal was to investigate socioeconomic and demographic factors that might be related to candidates' performance in the ENEM. Rather than developing predictive models, we chose to focus our efforts on creating informative and intuitive data visualizations. The purpose was to interpret these visualizations to identify patterns and trends that could provide insights into the factors that enhance or limit students' performance on the exam.

### [CO2 Emissions-Analysis for Korea Electric Power Corporation](CO2-Emissions-Analysis-for-Korea-Electric-Power-Corporation)
- Description: This project analyzes energy consumption and CO2 emissions at Korea Electric Power Corporation, focusing on seasonal patterns and operational efficiency. Using various visualizations, we explore energy usage across different load types and timeframes, revealing insights into how these factors influence emissions. The analysis aims to identify optimization opportunities, guiding sustainable practices and energy efficiency initiatives within the steel industry.
